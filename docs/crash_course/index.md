# Compilers Crash Course
This is an (ideally) non-technical crash course on three things:

- What compilers *are*

- How they work

- Why they matter in the modern computing ecosystem

It shouldn't require any programming knowledge to understand
most of it, and the parts that do require programming knowledge
are clearly marked.
