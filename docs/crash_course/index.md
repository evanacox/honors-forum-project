# Compilers Crash Course

This is a non-technical crash course on three things:

1. What even is a compiler? 
2. How do they work at a high level?
3. Why do they matter today?

It shouldn't require any programming knowledge to understand most of it, and the parts that do require programming knowledge
are clearly marked (and are not paramount to understanding the overall ideas).
