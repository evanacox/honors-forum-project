# About My Senior Project

For my Senior Project, I decided to try my hand at writing the code for a compiler (see the "Crash Course" section 
for what that is). I made the entire program myself, and as I did so, I wrote articles that explain the following
three things in simple terms (with no programming knowledge required!):

1. What even is a compiler? 
3. How do they work at a high level?
2. Why do they matter today?

In addition, I did more technical write-ups that are aimed at a student interesting in doing their own compiler project
to learn what I did in mine, why, and how it works. 

## Site Tour

On the sidebar, the components of the project can be found. 

The "Crash Course" section has a series of articles that answer the three numbered questions above.
